We have a small building out in the back, about 12&prime;x16&prime;. It was originally intended to be a furniture storage shed for keeping our outdoor stuff protected from Ottawa winters. Well, the builders were doing such a nice job, and the place turned out way better than expected, so we turned it into a little "Gazebo", a little place to escape to when the world is a bit too crazy, or you just want some quiet on a nice spring day.

So we did it up a little nicer than your typical storage shed, putting in some nice flooring and drywall etc. A TV an a bed were also added, but the bed was a bit too big, so I made this custom bedframe. Its a low riding frame to keep the size down, made of white oak and plywood.

It was a pretty simple standard project, and we can't have that, so I added some LED lighting to the outside rim of the frame to give it some pizzaz. Details below.

## The Box

### The Board

This project was made from offcuts of the Walnut Table I had just made. The table was of such a length that it left plenty of pieces to choose from.

I chose this piece because it was wide enough to slice in half and still have some timber to play with.

### The Cut

So I made all the cuts, and put it back together with each piece in its original location.

As you can see, you have to plan and position the cuts well in advance, and make sure you do the mitres right, else it's all for naught.

### The Carve

The carve was done with the {{ site.data.links.origin }}, and it turned out pretty well.

Only complication was that I had to make sure that didn't damage the fine point on the mitred edges when locking the board down for the cut.

The font is called _Satisfy_, which is oddly satisfying.

## Join and Finish

### Glue-up Prep

Dry fit before the glue-up shown here. I think I must have dry fit this one about a dozen times before committing to it.

It was those dividers that were being kind of finicky. They didn't want to stay firm or align properly. A little sanding and some gentle persuasion did the trick.

### The Glue-up

Band clamps are great for mitred boxes as the put the force on the corner joints inward towards the centre of the box.

### Lilly's Creations

A subtle epoxy inlay done here, and coated with {{ site.data.links.rubio }} to bring out the richness of the walnut.
