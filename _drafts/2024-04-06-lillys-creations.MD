In this project, I created a companion piece for the [walnut table]({% post_url /woodworking/2024-01-22-walnut-table %}) that I built in early 2024.  It's not a big piece, but there is some detail of interest, like the engraving and the dividers.

## The Box

### The Legs

So the legs were fun and different. We set out to mimic the design of our dining room table upstairs, I went back and forth a lot on the best way to do that.

Do I cut a bunch of similar parts, but have many more parts, then glue them all together? Or do I make fewer parts, but each part more customized. The former is easier to do, but the glue-up is much more difficult. The latter is more complicated to make the pieces, but far fewer pieces to glue-up.

I decided on the latter approach and I think it was for the best. The glue-ups were pretty complicated as it was, so I wouldn't want to make them any more difficult.

### The Top

When it comes to the table top, you start with a bunch of boards. Here they are, laid out and ready for initial milling.

This was a pretty good batch of lumber from {{ site.data.links.kjp }} but there were a few really curved boards, so I had to go back for a couple more.

### The Glue-up

The table top shown here, glued together and finished with {{ site.data.links.rubio }} walnut oil 2C. Great stuff.

### The Legs Fin

The assembly of the legs is a surprising amount of work. Next time you are at a dining table, take a look under. Not that I want to encourage this habit at your finer dining establishments, but there is likely to be a whole lot going on under there.

The metal brackets in the corners was probably overkill, as the {{ site.data.links.domino }} XL was used to put in some big 80mm tenons. There are four tenons in each corner, which should give it more than enough strength. BooYah!

## The Benches

{% include html-side.html img="IMG_0634.jpeg" align="left" %}

### Bench Legs

The bench legs followed the same general design pattern as the table legs, just scaled down to 2/3 the size of the table. This scaling was a general rule for the benches, which I intentionally broke in a few places, like in the support stretchers for the bench-tops, which I made as thick as I reasonably could to make sure it was strong enough.

### Bench Tops

The bench tops were a lot easier than the table top. Each of them is a little less than half that of the table top, so there is much less worry about warps and twists.

The photo here makes the tops look a little blotchy. I don't know why. In real life they are much smoother and look way better than this photo. I gotta work on my photography skills.

### Bench Legs Fin

These are the bench table legs. The inside stretchers in the middle are really just for alignment of the outside stretchers, keeping them parallel.

## Putting It All Together

So you put the tops on the legs of both the tables and the two benches, assembled with some funky z-clips to avoid any expansion and contraction issues, and then you bring it all together and you have this.

Here is a mini photo gallery of the table and benches setup in our theatre room. Click on a pic to zoom in for details if you are so inclined.
