## Installation

Please fork the repo as you like.  There is no co-development going on in this repo, so not much sense in cloning.

This was built on a windows machine, and requires the following additional apps to be installed.
  - FFMPEG
  - ImageMajick

## Usage

Thats a bit long.  Start with searches on Jekyll and Github Pages.  Go from there.

This was built on Windows and there are a couple of pre-jekyll-build steps to run via Windows Powershell
  - To generate thumbnail images from your post images, you'll need to run gen-thumbnails.ps1.
  - To generate the captions data file (_data.img-info.json) you'll need to run gen-imagecaptions.ps1
