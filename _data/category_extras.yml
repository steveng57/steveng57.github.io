# Optional per-category intros and featured posts for generated category pages.
#
# Keys are the category path segments joined with '/', matching `page.category_path`.
# Examples:
#   "Woodworking": top-level Woodworking landing page
#   "Woodworking/Workshop": nested Workshop under Woodworking
#
# Each entry may define:
#   intro_markdown: |-
#     Short Markdown intro rendered above the post list.
#   intro_html: |-
#     Alternate raw HTML intro (used if intro_markdown is not present).
#   featured_slugs:
#     - post-slug-1   # matches `post.slug` (usually the filename without date)
#     - post-slug-2
#
# All fields are optional; if a category has no entry here, the layout
# behaves exactly as before.
#
# Example (uncomment and customize to use):
#
"Woodworking":
  intro_markdown: |-
    Woodworking projects from the workshop, from early builds to
    more recent experiments with joinery, finishes, and design.
"Home and Garden":
  intro_markdown: |-
    Projects and ideas for improving and beautifying living spaces,
    indoors and out.  Tech projects for the home and garden also appear here.
#  featured_slugs:
#    - walnut-table
#    - daybed
