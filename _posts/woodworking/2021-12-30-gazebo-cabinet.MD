This is actually a pretty beefy piece, the pictures don't seem to capture the scale of it.  I think that is because it is actually pretty deep.  We had originally planned for this to hold a small fridge and microwave, so we had to make it big enough to hold the largest item.

As big as it is, and with red oak being a relatively heavy hardwood, well it is another one of my classic, "Geez is this thing heavy" pieces.  Yep, this thing is 100% solid oak, no plywood at all here.

## The Design

{% include html-side.html img="gazebo-cabinet-sketchup.jpeg" align="left" %}

### Sketchup

I created a {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} drawing to get things going again.  It was around this time that I started using some of the advanced layout tools to generate cut-lists automatically.  

You need to get it done right in Sketchup and there is a bit of extra work to do in labelling your parts, but once you do, you hit a button, and your cut-list is auto-generated for you.  Print it off and take it down to the shop, and you are off to the races.

Yeah, I am a geek, I know it.  I have embraced it.

## The Cabinet

{% include html-sxs.html img1="IMG_0760.jpeg" img2="IMG_0758C.jpeg" %}

We built this to fit under the tv in the gazebo.  The gazebo is the name for a small building we have in the back that is setup as a little getaway room.  Its a pretty cool little spot.

We were going to put a little fridge and microwave in there, but current thinking is that I will add a drawer and a door to the right side instead.  Then we can hide more messy things in there.

## Materials

- Red Oak {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- {{ site.data.links.rubio }} Intense Black Precolour Easy, Black Oil 2C for finish
- {{ site.data.links.domino }} for pretty much all joinery, except pocket holes for the back stretchers
