One of my first tricky projects was a bean bag toss game. Fun and games around the pool in the back yard.

## Getting to Work

I hadn't done a whole lot of circles and curves with the router before. This changed that in a hurry. To make the curves on the outside rim, I had to make a really big jig, like six feet long that provided the proper radius.

The inner circles were just done with a router circle jig I crafted. Drilled some pilot holes for the jig pin to fit in, and off to the races.

## Mistakes Were Made

Copious amounts of waterproof glue helped fix the situation.

### Cedar and Ply

While the face board was just your vanilla big-box-store plywood, the back boards were made of cedar. My thinking at the time was that this choice would be a good one since these are outdoors and on the grass a lot. The problem is that cedar is a very soft wood, and my screws were doing all kinds of wonky things, most problematically not staying were they should.

The two Bag Toss Boards were later painted candy-apple red.

### Playtime

These are taken out many times every summer and it's pretty cool to see people having fun with them. It never gets old.

Debbie stamped some dog paw prints on the final version which made it look really cool. I will add a pic of that when the spring thaw comes and the back yard is a little more accessible.
