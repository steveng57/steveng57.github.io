Shop furniture is the best place to practice.  In this case it was practice with dowels, rods, and other round things.  

## Under Construction

![Dolly Right][Dolly 2]{: .left .w-66}The shop vac worked well enough, but it was always getting clogged and was quite the mess to clean.  I decided to do an upgrade to the cyclone separator, and added a HEPA filter to keep the air clean.  But once you do that, you also need a way to move it around the shop.  I went with the low profile for this vacuum dolly, cause if you make the vertically stacked kind, it would have a strong tendency to topple.  Which with me in my shop was guaranteed to happen every time I used it.

![Dolly Left][Dolly 1]{: .right .w-66}This is the dolly from the other side.

Yah know, I was going to insert some cute lyrics from the Louis Armstrong song, "Hello Dolly", but I looked them up and the lyrics are a tad misogynistic and creepy.  Eek.
