Shop furniture is the best place to practice. In this case it was practice with dowels, rods, and other round things.

## Under Construction

### Cyclone Upgrade

The shop vac worked well enough, but it was always getting clogged and was quite the mess to clean. I decided to do an upgrade to the cyclone separator, and added a HEPA filter to keep the air clean. But once you do that, you also need a way to move it around the shop.

I went with the low profile for this vacuum dolly, cause if you make the vertically stacked kind, it would have a strong tendency to topple. Which, with me in my shop, it was guaranteed to happen every time I used it.

### Maple Rods

This is the dolly from the other side.

Yah know, I was going to insert some cute lyrics from the Louis Armstrong song, "Hello Dolly", but I looked them up and the lyrics are a tad misogynistic and creepy. Eek.

## In Production

This gets a **lot** of use in the shop. It hasn't fallen over on me yet, but there is still time.
