I've made various decorative trays over the years.  These usually serve as centre pieces for a table, and hold things like candles or ornaments.

## Background

These are pretty simple to make, basically a box without a lid.  But they are great for practice and developing skills and joinery techniques.

In my early versions of these, I made them entirely out of solid wood, mostly red oak.  This is all good, but with the bottom made out of solid wood, well they are heavy.  Too heavy in some cases.  The one on the dining table is hard for me to lift.  If I were to make these today, I would make the bottoms out of plywood, make thinner sides, and maybe even use a different wood to save on the weight.

Candles left too long in the sun.  I'm melting...

![Tray2]{: .right .w-66 }
This tray was left outside in the rain once...

![Tray3]{: .left .w-66 }
This is the one that weighs a ton...or two.
{% include clear-float.html %}

>**Pro tip**: Don't make something so heavy that even you can't lift it.
