I made a few things for the outdoor area by the pool, just to add some decoration. One was a long centerpiece with some engravings, the other was a couple of small round trays for candles or other decorations. It's probably obvious that they were built to resemble the [serving trays]({% post_url /woodworking/2023-04-20-serving-trays %}) that were made around the same time.

One turned out great, the other...not so much. Read on for details!

> **Pro tip**: Wood moves. Sometimes a lot. It bends, twists, warps, cups. It has a mind of its own really, and sometimes just feels uncomfortable in its own skin.

## Table Decorations

### Long Center&#x200B;piece

This centerpiece was made to fit on our outdoor table near the pool. As of this writing, it's still winter, so the piece is indoors for protection.

I tried practising finger joints (aka box joints) on this one. They turned out nice and flush.

Pretty straightforward stuff on this one. By now, I have the epoxy thing down pretty well. Stained it espresso to match the rest of the outdoor furniture. _Espresso_ sounds so much more pretentious than _black_, don't you think?

### The Round Center&#x200B;pieces

These were made out of solid red oak boards, glued up to make a small panel. I then used a router with a circle jig to make the final shape.

Even though they are sold oak, they still warped quite a bit in the elements. I am not sure if they are even salvageable at this point, but I'll see what I can do.
