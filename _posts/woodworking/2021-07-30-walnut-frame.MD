"I've been framed!!!", said the yellow bird to the blue bird.  This one was pretty simple but it's one of the first things I did in walnut.  Beautiful wood to work with.  A little smelly, but I try not to inhale.

## Details

Debbie found these cute little guys at a local art centre.  We thought they would look good together, having a little group chat.

Pretty simple, only tricky part was mounting and positioning the individual pieces of artwork so that they could be screwed into the backing in the right spot.

## In the Gazebo

This is where I will place a pic of the frame in the Gazebo.  But its winter and I don't want to trek out there just for this.  Here is a place holder.

## Materials

- Walnut from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- {{ site.data.links.domino }} (to strengthen the miters)
- "Infinity" clips to mount the backing to the outside frame from {{ site.data.links.leevalley }}
