## Origins

"I've been framed!!!", said the yellow bird to the blue bird. This one was pretty simple but it's one of the first things I did in walnut. Beautiful wood to work with. A little smelly, but I try not to inhale.

100% solid walnut, throughout.

## The Details

### Local Artist

Debbie found these cute little guys at a local art centre. We thought they would look good together, having a little group chat.

### Local Birds

Pretty simple, only tricky part was mounting and positioning the individual pieces of artwork so that they could be screwed into the backing in the right spot.

## In the Gazebo

Here they are in there new home, getting all chatty and hanging out.

## Placeholder

When I first wrote this blog entry, I had not yet taken the above picture, so instead I put a placeholder just for giggles. The thing is though, I have now grown attached to this placeholder so I am going to leave it right where it is.

## Materials

- Walnut from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- {{ site.data.links.domino }} (to strengthen the miters)
- "Infinity" clips to mount the backing to the outside frame from {{ site.data.links.leevalley }}
