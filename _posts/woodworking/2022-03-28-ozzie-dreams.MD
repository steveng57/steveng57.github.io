A true labour of love. Our boy Ozzie needed a new place to sleep. It seems he was never very content to stay in one place at night, so we thought we would make him a nice new comfy spot to be in.

## Under Construction

Lots and lots of slats on this one. About 30+ of them all up. Using the Festool Domino for the loose-tenon joinery made things a bit easier.

Stained, hard-wax oil applied and ready for the epoxy inlay.

## Don't Bother Me

Epxoy inlay complete, pillows installed and Ozzie giving it a trial run.
