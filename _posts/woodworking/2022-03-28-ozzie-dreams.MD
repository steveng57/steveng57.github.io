This was true labour of love. Our boy Ozzie needed a new place to sleep. It seems he was never very content to stay in one place at night, so we thought we would make him a nice new comfy spot to be in.

## Under Construction

### Slats

Lots and lots of slats on this one. About 30+ of them all up. Using the {{ site.data.links.domino }} for the loose-tenon joinery made things a bit easier.

By this point in my wood working career, I had figured out how to make things a little bit lighter. The bottom is a much thinner plywood, but has a support in the centre to keep it strong.

### Wow, It Worked

Stained with {{ site.data.links.rubio }} hard-wax oil applied and ready for the epoxy inlay.

I finally had the good sense to make this piece a little lighter than my others. While the slats are solid wood, red oak, the bottom is a thinner, lighter plywood, making it somewhat easier to move around.

## Don't Bother Me

Epoxy inlay complete, pillows installed and Ozzie giving it a trial run.

## Materials
