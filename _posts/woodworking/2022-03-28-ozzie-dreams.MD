A true labour of love. Our boy Ozzie needed a new place to sleep. It seems he was never very content to stay in one place at night, so we thought we would make him a nice new comfy spot to be in.

## Under Construction

![Construction 1][Construction 1]{: .right .w-66}Lots and lots of slats on this one. About 30+ of them all up. Using the {{ site.data.links.domino }} for the loose-tenon joinery made things a bit easier.  By this point in my wood working career, I had fiqured out how to make things a little bit lighter.  The bottom is a much thinner plywood, but has a support in the centre to keep it strong.

![Construction 2][Construction 2]{: .left .w-66}Stained, {{ site.data.links.rubio }} hard-wax oil applied and ready for the epoxy inlay.

## Don't Bother Me

Epoxy inlay complete, pillows installed and Ozzie giving it a trial run.
