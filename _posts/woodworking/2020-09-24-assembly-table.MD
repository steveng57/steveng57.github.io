## Background

I've always wanted a **monster** sized assembly table. They are great to spread your project out and do all kinds of things from cuts, to glue-ups, to finishing.

While I love me previous assembly table, it was kinda small, only about 2.5 feet by 3.5 feet. Projects just wouldn't fit on it, and it was always a worry that something, either a workpiece or my favorite tool, was going to fall off the end. There is nothing like being able to spread yourself out and visualize your work, and do it with confidence.

## Design

It was a long project, and a detailed one. It was about two months thru the design process, and another month in actual construction.

### The Frame

After watching countless YouTube videos on large assembly tables, I did the basic design.

Since this was a pretty big undertaking, and my aluminum skills are near zero, I decided to work with a company called {{ site.data.links.vention }} for the next stages of the design work. They are based in Montreal and specialize in "Industrial Automation", but they will take on orders and projects of any size. They also have offices and distribution capabilities in the US and Europe.

**They are totally awesome and fantastic.** They did all the detailed design work in their CAD tooling, with lots of back and forth until we got all the bits right. Then they made all the parts and shipped them to me on a couple of large pallettes. I cannot recommend them any more highly, so if you are in the market for anything of the aluminum extrusion variety, you need to give them try.

### Weekend Warrior

The basic frame took a couple of weekends to assemble.

Having not done this kind of thing, there were a fair amount of assembly, oops, disassembly, assembly cycles throughout. One has to make sure everything is square in all three dimensions, otherwise you are setting yourself up for trouble down the road. Which there was plenty of.

## The Shelves and the Top

### Pull-Outs

The pull-out shelves were another project unto themselves. There is a lot of extrusion holding them together, they are super strong. But there are 19 of them, eight on each side with three in the front, so assembly time on those was a couple of evenings at least.

### The Top

The MDF top was yet another whole project. The 4x8 sheet of MDF was used to create an MFT (Multi-Function Table) table, in the style of Festool MFT/3, with 20mm diameter holes spaced 96mm apart. There are 288 of these holes. Let me say that again, **there are 288 of them!** I know this because I drilled each and every one of them. A smarter person would have gotten them drilled on someone's CNC machine, but I don't know anyone that has one of those, and I haven't added it to my shop yet. Yet.

Anyway, there is a special jig you can get from {{ site.data.links.leevalley }} called the [Mk.II Parf Guide Drilling System](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/jigs-guides-and-fixtures/110468-mk-ii-parf-guide-drilling-system?item=58B3996){{ site.tb }} which lets you drill the holes with perfect spacing and squareness. It is very cool.
