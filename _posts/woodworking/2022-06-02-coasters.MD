These coasters were probably the second project I made with the {{ site.data.links.origin }} and epoxy inlay. They turned out ok, buts that only because I threw the first four of them out. The epoxy would bleed into the surrounding wood, and when attempting to sand that out, I sanded too deep and the image was lost. I learned two things:

## Puppy Coasters

### Happy Puppy

This little guy is my favorite. She has the same spirit and joy as our boys. I found the design somewhere on the internet and modified it in Inkscape and then loading it onto the {{ site.data.links.origin }}.

### A Classic

The paws are definitely a classic. Very much an overdone classic, yes, but still a classic.

Fun and easy to do.

## The Whole Gang

Here are all eight of the coasters, two sets of four, one set in maple and the other in walnut.

The only one I do not like is the _Picasso dog_ on the right. I found the design on the internet and modified it, like the others. Unfortunately, he reminds me of a dog that is in the middle of doing his business, and once you see that, you can't un-see it. Sorry.
