## Introduction

These picture frames are sometimes called "Shadow Boxes" or "Shadow Frames". They really add a lot to the artwork that they frame. I have a bunch more to do, but these are a good start.

## Under Construction

Nothing too fancy here, but there is a bit of finesse in making them strong, since the frame thickness is just a little over one centimeter. {{ site.data.links.domino }}s are strategically placed at the mitres to give added strength, and while they are a bit of extra work, they make alignment during the glue-up much easier.

### New Paint

I used a new kind of paint on this one, mixing a couple of colours together to get just the right shade. The interior of the frame is painted black to accentuate the shadow effect.

It's an acrylic paint I picked up at {{ site.data.links.michaels }}.

### Poplar is Poplar

I made these out of poplar. It's a lighter wood, but still strong enough. Not as sappy as pine, and paints very well. Less pricey than other woods, and if you are going to paint it anyway, might as well spend more on the paint and less on the wood.

### Being Framed

I used shims to centre the picture vertically and horizontally in the frame. I have some of those woodworkers shims, which are made of plastic and they are of varying thicknesses. But my favorite shims for such a task is playing cards. Yep, good old fashioned playing cards. I keep a deck in the shop at all times for such a purpose.

The trick to keeping it centred is that if you use 7 cards on the left, then you need to use 7 cards on the right.
