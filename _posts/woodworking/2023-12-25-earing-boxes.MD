I really like making special things for other people. This is a fun example of that. Debbie thought it would be cool to make a set of earing boxes for her sister for Christmas. I could not agree more. This was a first of its kind for me. While I have made a great many boxes in the past, the insert was a whole new kind of thing.

> **Cool Tool**: The {{ site.data.links.shaper }} was critical here, no way I could make this with just tools. It is truly an amazing machine.

## Under Construction

Doing the finishing on this one was pretty messy, partly due to the number of pieces, and also all the nooks and crannies to get into.

Nice to have a big work surface to spread out.  Especially when you are a messy, messy woodworker.

{% include html-side.html img="IMG_0466.jpeg" align="right" sidebar = "Squares" %}

The insert with all the squares was cut as a separate piece from the main box. It was carved using the {{ site.data.links.origin }} from a single block of walnut.  This left me with about 72 little cubes of walnut that I still haven't figured out what to do with.

{% include clear-float.html break = 1 %}

{% include html-side.html img = "IMG_0467.jpeg" align = "left" sidebar  = "Velvet" %}

The green velvet was placed on the bottom of the box and the insert placed over it.

The top engraving was a little nerve wracking. Make a mistake here and its hard to patch nicely.

## Ready

Here they are, ready and waiting for the big day.

## In Position

All filled with all kinds of earings. Looks like I might have to make more!
