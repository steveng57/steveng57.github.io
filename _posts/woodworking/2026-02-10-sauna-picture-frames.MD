## Background
We got some cool prints that matched the theme we were going for in the new sauna building out back, which I would have to describe as "contemporary organic", meaning marbles, tiles, and woods, but with a modern spa-like styling.

I know this is my fourth post on picture frames, and that might get a little repetitive, so I have included a puppet show at the end for your entertainment, stay tuned.

## The Design
I did NOT use Sketchup for this one, so it proves I can do some things on the fly.  It's the same design as the last two in the series, a _"shadow box"_ frame.  The difference here is that the other two were painted poplar, but this set of frames are made from white oak.  Some foreshadowing: white oak is **way** harder than poplar.  If you look at the Janka hardness scale, it is about 2.5 times harder.

## Construction

### Mistakes Out of the Gate

This was bad.  Ugly bad.  So when making frames like this, you start with a board that is about 25mm (an inch) thick, and from that you want to rip it down the middle on the bandsaw to get two pieces, one about 12mm thick and the other about 7mm thick.  This allows for a little bit of waste and accounts for the kerf of the blade, which is about 1.5mm thick.  

But I made a couple or three mistakes here.  First, this board is almost 20cm (8in) wide, meaning the bandsaw blade has to cut all the way through that.  Second, my bandsaw blade was a little dull for white oak, which is a pretty hard hardwood.  Third, I didn't have the right setup on the bandsaw.  Fourth, rather than looking at the entire board as I was cutting, I was focussed on just the top part, and did not realize the bottom was going totally wonky on me.  And fifth...and sixth...

### The Pain Continues

It's not supposed to look like this.  

When you cut a board down the middle, it is supposed to have wood on both sides.  In my case 7mm thick on one side, and 12mm thick on the other.  This side is neither.

It was such a botched mess, I just turned off the bandsaw and walked away.  When it's not working, it's best to take a break and come back with a clear head.

### The Fix Is In

{% include html-sxs.html img1="IMG_2301.avif" img2="IMG_2302.avif" %}

So when I came back the next day, shaking off the shear disgust of my previous efforts, I did a couple of things to make things work.  The number one fix was to cut the boards down to about 40mm from 200mm in width so that the bandsaw had a lot less to chew on as it went through the board.  Next thing was to get a brand new blade, which proved to make a real difference: it cut through the white oak like a chainsaw through a dandelion.  I also did a bunch of little things like a better bandsaw setup, proper out-feed support etc.

### Clamps and Glue

After cutting the rabbet (not rabbit my fellow woodworkers!), it was time for the dominos on the corner mitres and some glue and clamps.

### Back Braces in Place

{% include html-side.html img="IMG_2310.avif" align="left" %}

Armed with an 18 gauge brad-nailer, I glued the back braces in place.  

The braces are made from the 7mm cuts mentioned above, and they are not visible when the frame is complete, so they are sometimes rough and only partially finished.  They are for stability, strength and ensuring the outer boards are straight.  The artwork itself is mounted directly to these with screws from the underside, so they need to be solid.

{% include clear-float.html break=1 %}

### Finished

After trying a number of different shades of grey Rubio Monocoat hard-wax oils, we settled on a colour called _Affogato_.

I'm in!!!

See, they are almost exactly the same!

### Alignment Issues

So one of the more challenging aspects of this build was that the artwork itself was neither square nor straight.  Both pieces had been in the basement for quite a while, and stuff like that will happen over time.  The corners were out of square sometimes by as much as five degrees, and if you looked down an edge you could see a lot of bowing.  It was nasty, like a full centimeter bend on the larger piece.

I had to use copious amounts of clamps and spacers (the blue, white, red, and green plastic things in the pic) to get things aligned properly in the frames before screwing them in place.

## Done and Ready

After all that, they were ready to go.

## In Production

Once we get these frames installed in the new sauna, we will take some pics and publish them here.  Stay tuned, I think they are going to look great!

## Puppet Show

So here is the puppet show I promised earlier...well look at that, we're out of time.  It will have to wait until the next post.
