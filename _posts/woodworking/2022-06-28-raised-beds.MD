These were a big first. Cedar Raised Beds for outback. These two were placed outside, for growing tomatoes and things. I made three more (not pictured here) that were eventually placed in our small greenhouse out back.

When the weather gets warmer, I will head out back and take some pics of the finished product and post here.

## Under Construction

![Angle 1][Angle 1]{: .left .w-66 }The Western Red Cedar was purchased just down the way from where I live at a place called {{ site.data.links.woodsource }}. They have a great selection of hardwood and supplies to choose from. Its nice to have a place like this just a few minutes away.

![Angle 2][Angle 2]{: .right .w-66}These were eventually finished with another product from The Wood Source called [Cutek Extreme], which is an outdoor wood protection oil. The neat thing about this stuff is that they have a pretty broad spectrum of colouring called "Colourtone" that you can add to the base product so that you can get exactly the colour you want.
