This one was really simple, but a much needed project. Just a box really, but a couple of steps to make life easier for Riley and Ozzie, jumping up on the daybed, or on the mudroom desk to get ready to go for a walk. We have two of these, one for the yoga room, and another for the mud room.

## Under Construction

### A First

This was the first time I attempted any engraving or detail work like this, note the paws on both steps. The first set of paw prints for the mudroom were done freehand with a stencil and a palm router and then painted.

### The Carve

The second set of prints was done with my new {{ site.data.links.shaper }}. Much more on this tool in coming posts, it is one of my favorite things ever.

In both the yoga room and mudroom steps, the prints were carved about 6mm deep.

## In Production

### Mudroom

This step must get used about 20 times a day.

It's in the mudroom and serves as a way to get the boys up to the desk for cleaning, grooming, or putting on winter gear. They are quite used to it now, they bounce right up without hesitation.
