This one was really simple, but a much needed project. Just a box really, but a couple of steps to make life easier for Riley and Ozzie, jumping up on the daybed, or on the mudroom desk to get ready to go for a walk.  We have two of these, one for the yoga room, and another for the mud room.

## Under Construction

![Step 1][Step 1]{: .left .w-66 }This was the first time I attempted any engraving or detail work like this, note the paws on both steps. The first set of paw prints for the mudroom were done freehand with a stencil and a palm router and then painted.

![Step 2][Step 2]{: .right .w-66 }The second set of prints was done with my new {{ site.data.links.shaper }}. Much more on this tool in coming posts, its one of my favorite things ever. In both cases, the prints were carved about 6mm deep.
