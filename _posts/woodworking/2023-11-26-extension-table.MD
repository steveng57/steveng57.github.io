This was my first project using Ash. It's a very nice hardwood, similar to Red Oak but with a little less grain, though not totally closed pores.

That texture made it a nice fit for this project, which was to exactly match an existing dining table that we had in the theatre room.

The thinking is that when not in use, it sits against the wall and acts as a serving table. When in use and we have a larger group of people, we slide it over and up against the existing dining table.

> **Chocolate stain**: Chocolate is a wonderful thing to eat, and it makes for a nice stain colour too.

## Under Construction

{% include html-side.html img="IMG_0216.jpeg" align="center" %}
There was a deep gouge in the top of this that took a fair amount of epoxy and sanding to make disappear. If you know where to look...actually no, you can't see it at all.

Mmmm...{{ site.data.links.rubio }} **Chocolate** was the colour used here. Mmmm...

### Apron

Normally an apron, seen in the foreground here, is situated between the legs of the table, helping to keep them sturdy. In this case, the apron is purely decorative, as the legs will attach to the underside of the table and be inset a fair amount.

### Metal Legs

The metal legs look a little spindly here, but that is for a reason. When the table is used in "extension mode" it is moved next to the dining table. When seated at it, the legs had to be inset to give diners ample legroom and not to bang their knees.

With the legs inset as such, I was a bit worried the table would be top-heavy, but it is surprisingly stable. You would have to take a pretty good run at it to knock it over.

I bought these from {{ site.data.links.rustydesign }}, an Ontario based company outside Toronto. Great quality, great selection, and good prices. Check them out.

### Edging

The tricky part was getting the edging to look the same as on the original table. The blocks on the end and the groove on the edge are part of that.

This is where overflow stuff will go when we have family dinners. More importantly, this is where the munchies will go when we watch movies in the theatre.

## In Position

In situ as an extension to the existing table. I levelled it to the exact height of the other table so that people are less likely to spill things, which sounds easy but our theatre room floor is not very level. Not an exact colour match, but close enough I think.

This makes for a nice big dining area that can comfortably seat ten people, with lots of room in the middle for serving plates. Makes me hungry.

## Materials

- Ash, both 2&Prime; thick and 1&Prime; from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- Metal legs purchased from {{ site.data.links.rustydesign }}. The irony (see what I did there) is not lost on me.
- Rubio Monocoat and Chocolate Precolour Easy.
