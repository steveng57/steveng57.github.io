This was my first project using Ash. Its a very nice hardwood, similar to Red Oak but with a little less grain, but not totally closed pores.

That texture made it a nice fit for this project, which was to exactly match an existing dining table that we had in the theatre room.

The thinking is that when not in use, it sits against the wall and acts as a serving table. When in use and we have a larger group of people, we slide it over and up against the existing dining table.

## Under Construction

There was a deep gouge in the top of this that took a fair amount of epoxy and sanding to make disappear. If you know where to look...actually no, you can't see it at all.

## In Position

The metal legs look a little spindly here, but that is for a reason. When the table is used in "extension mode" it is moved next to the dining table. When seated at it, the legs had to be inset to give diners ample legroom and not to bang their knees.

The tricky part was getting the edging to look the same as on the original table. The blocks on the end and the groove on the edge are part of that.

_Looking good_

## Materials

- Ash
- Metal legs purchased from {{ site.data.links.rustydesign }}. The irony (see what I did there) is not lost on me.
- Rubio Monocoat and Chocolate Precolour Easy.
