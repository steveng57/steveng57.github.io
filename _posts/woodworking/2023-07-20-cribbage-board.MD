For my father's birthday, I made him this walnut cribbage board. He says it is working well and that it keeps very good score.

Almost half the work on this one was at the computer making sure the design was right.  I didn't do the entire layout, I spent about $20 for a design off of Etsy, then made a bunch of modifications using the online tools from {{ site.data.links.shaperhub }}.

## Under Contruction

Lots of pictures on this one.  Hey, it was a lot of work.

The sheer madness of trying to do 391 individual holes with the router, even a computerized one, is...well...madness.  

First you need to be sure that the computerized layout has no flaws.  If you discover one in the middle of the cut, well good luck with that.  

Then you need to _grid_ it all up.  That means to mount it on the table securely, get it aligned right, then set a grid to the outer dimensions of the board, and place your drawing in the right spot.

Then you can start cutting, but you need to do it all in a single pass.  No taking a break and coming back after lunch.

_391 holes.  Go ahead...count 'em._

Finishing this one was a little tricky too.  I use a hard-wax oil called {{ site.data.links.rubio }} for most of my projects theses days.  It makes for a great, durable, and repairable finish.  It is also way less finicky that other finishes: you apply it, wait a bit, and wipe off the excess.  Dust does not really stick to it, so shop dust is not so much of a problem.

But then there was the problem of the wax and the holes.  The was loved to get in there, but the look was not good, and I am sure the functionality would have been even worse.  But a 1/8 inch drill bit came to my rescue ,


## The Backside

On the back, I did a little signature thing.  I eventually fixed the half-finished g in August.  I also carved out a couple of storage holes for pegs with a magnetic seal.
