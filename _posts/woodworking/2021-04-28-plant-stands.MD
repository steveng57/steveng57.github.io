Its always nice when you work on a piece that is going to be on display.  I also like mixing materials into my projects, and these ceramic pots were just the ticket to go along with the espresso stained oak stands.

## Details

### The Stands

![The Stands][Stands 3]{: .left .w-66 }The stands were cool to make, truly a 3d glue-up.  A small taper on the legs gives it a nice look.  I used General Finishes stain and polyurethane for the finish.  Its nice stuff, very durable and looks good.  Only problem I have with it is that it gives the workpiece a slightly plastic feel, and if you put too many coats, it can start to look a little like plastic.  Which is fine if you want to make something shiny.  Polyurethane does this because, well, it is plastic.

I've made three of these of varying sizes.

### The Pots

![The Pots][Stands 2]{: .right .w-66 }After a couple weeks of letting the ceramic cure, I put nice white glaze on them.  Then I fired up the kiln and baked the pots at around 700 degrees F for about 4 hours, and they came out nice.  Nah, not really. I bought them on Amazon for about $70 each.  I would tell you the brand name, but they are not selling them anymore.

### Assembled

![Assembled][Stands 1]{: .w-66 .left }It was important to get the sizes just right.  You don't want too large or small a gap between the pot and the stand.  Too big and it will look silly, too small and well... good luck with that.  Sometimes I am actually amazed that my measurements work out at all, but thankfully they did here.

### All Done

Ta da!  All dressed up with freshly potted plants and in their new home, though we do move them around around a bit.
