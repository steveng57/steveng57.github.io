It is always nice when you work on a piece that is going to be on display.  I also like mixing materials into my projects, and these ceramic pots were just the ticket to go along with the espresso stained oak stands.

## Details

### The Design

{% include html-side.html img="plant-stands-sketchup.jpeg" align="right" %}
This seems a bit silly looking back on it now, to have gone to this length in the design.  But it was a great way to learn {{ site.data.links.sketchup }}, which has been super valuable in many projects.

### The Stands

The stands were cool to make, truly a 3d glue-up.  A small taper on the legs gives it a nice look.  I used General Finishes stain and polyurethane for the finish.  It is very nice stuff, very durable and looks good.  Only problem I have with it is that it gives the workpiece a slightly plastic feel, and if you put too many coats, it can start to look a little like plastic.  Which is fine if you want to make something shiny.  Polyurethane does this because, well, it is plastic.

I've made three of these of varying sizes.

### The Pots

After a couple weeks of letting the ceramic cure, I put nice white glaze on them.  Then I fired up the kiln and baked the pots at around 700 degrees F for about 4 hours, and they came out nice.  

Nah, not really. I bought them on Amazon for about $70 each.  I would tell you the brand name, but they are not selling them anymore.

### Assembled

It was important to get the sizes just right.  You don't want too large or small a gap between the pot and the stand.  Too big and it will look silly, too small and well... good luck with that.  Sometimes I am actually amazed that my measurements work out at all, but thankfully they did here.

### All Done

Ta da!  All dressed up with freshly potted plants and in their new home, though we do move them around around a bit.
