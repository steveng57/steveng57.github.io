## Background
We've got some artwork around the place that needed some sprucing up.  Some of it is good stuff, some of it is the kind that you buy at Home Sense.  Either way, a nice frame can go a long way to making it look a notch or two better.

This is the second round of "Shadow Box" frames that I've done.  The first can be found here: [Picture Frames]({% post_url woodworking/2023-08-22-picture-frames %})

## The Originals

Always good to get a _"before"_ shot, since the _"after"_ should look so much better.  Here are pics of the original artworks without the frames.

Kinda blah right?  Definitely needs something to make them pop.

## Poplar to the Rescue.

Poplar is very popular.  Sorry, that joke never gets old, although Deb would say it got old about a decade ago.  Still, I can't help it.  Hey, this is my blog and I will put whatever lame jokes I want to in here.  Look, I am not forcing you to stay, you can move on if you like, but the bad jokes stay.  They are my trademark, I am known for them.  Yeah, I know I used the same lame joke on the original picture frames post, just let it go already!

### Clamping

After milling the wood to size and cutting to length, it was time for glue-up and clamping.

Strap clamps (the black ribbon around the sides here) are perfect for keeping a piece like this under control

### Glued and Nailed

I used the {{ site.data.links.domino }} for the joinery again.  It makes for a nice strong joint.  Though it had been such a long time since the last time I did it, it seemed I had to learn everything all over again.

Lots of excess glue visible here, but that is going to be painted black and on the inside edge, never to be seen.

I used 23 gauge pin nails on the backing pieces to hold it to the side pieces while the glue dried.

### Primed and Ready

The black paint/primer is applied to the whole thing, inside and out, but the outside is painted over with the metallic stuff.  The primer helps protect it, and provides a foundation for the final coats.

I had to do it in the garage because of the cold weather outside as it would not dry otherwise.  This made the whole house smell like a chemical factory.  Not doing that again...unless I have more painting to do...then maybe.

In the back of this pic you can see snow piled up and covering the window.  We had over 100cm of snow in the last week.
