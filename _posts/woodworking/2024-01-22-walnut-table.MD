This is perhaps my most complicated project to date, with the possible exception of the [daybed](/daybed).  It took about six or seven weeks.  The design called for the table to fit in a certain area in our theatre room.  We watch movies there, but its a big room and we also use it for other things.  This table is to serve as a craft table for my niece Lilly and any other folk who want to make stuff here.  You can make whatever you want at this table.

## Under Construction

![Table 1]{: .left .w-66 }So the legs were fun and different.  We set out to mimic the design of our dining room table upstairs, I went back and forth a lot on the best way to do that.  Do I cut a bunch of similar parts, but have many more parts, then glue them all together?  Or do I make fewer parts, but each part more customized.  The former is easier to do, but the glue-up is much more difficult.  The latter is more complicated to make the pieces, but far fewer pieces to glue-up.  I decided on the latter approach and I think it was for the best.  The glue-ups were pretty complicated as it was, so I wouldn't want to make them any more difficult.

![Table 2]{: .right .w-66 }When it comes to the table top, you start with a bunch of boards.  Here they are, laid out and ready for initial milling.  This was a pretty good batch of lumber from {{ site.data.links.kjp }} but there were a few really curved boards, so I had to go back for a couple more.
{% include clear-float.html %}

![Table 3]{: .left .w-66 }The table top shown here, glued together and finished with {{ site.data.links.rubio }} walnut oil 2C.  Great stuff.  
{% include clear-float.html %}

![Table 4]{: .right .w-66 }The assembly of the legs is a surprising amount of work.  Next time you are at a dining table, take a look under.  Not that I want to encourage this habit at your finer dining establishments, but there is likely to be a whole lot going on under there.  The metal brackets in the corners was probably overkill, as the {{ site.data.links.domino }} XL was used to put in some big 80mm tenons.  There are four tenons in each corner, which should give it more than enough strength.  BooYah!
{% include clear-float.html %}

![Table 5]{: .left .w-66 }The bench legs followed the same general design pattern as the table legs, just scaled down to 2/3 the size of the table.  This scaling was a general rule for the benches, which I intentionally broke in a few places.

The other difference is that there were twice as many legs on the benches.
{% include clear-float.html %}

![Table 6]{: .right .w-66 }The bench tops were a lot easier than the table top.  Each of them is a little less than half that of the table top, so there is much less worry about warps and twists.

The photo here makes the tops look a little blotchy.  I don't know why.  In real life they are much smoother and look way better than this photo.  I gotta work on my photography skills.

![Table 7]{: .left .w-66 }The bench table legs.  The inside stretchers in the middle are really just for alignment of the outside stretchers, keeping them parallel.
{% include clear-float.html %}

## Putting It All Together

So you put the tops on the legs of both the tables and the two benches, assembled with some funky z-clips to avoid any expansion and contraction issues, and then you bring it all together and you have this.

Here is a mini photo gallery of the table and benches setup in our theatre room.  Click on a pic to zoom in for details if you are so inclined.
