I went for a bit of the artsy, rustic look on these.  They were a bit tricky, in the sense that with the epoxy inlay in the tray bottom, suddenly decisions about which part to do first become important.  How do you assemble it, before or after the epoxy?  How do you finish it, before or after the epoxy?  Answers!  I demand answers.

## Tree Tray

![Tray 2][Tray 2]{: .left .w-66}The Tree Tray was done first, and so I learned how not do it here.  Basically on something like this, you need to sand and finish before final assembly, otherwise it it too difficult to get into corners and things.

## Flower Tray

![Tray 1][Tray 1]{: .right .w-66 }The Flower Tray is where the learnings were applied and turned out better than the tree, but they make a good set.

## Materials

- Poplar from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- Various coloured epoxies
- {{ site.data.links.shaper }} to carve the inlays
