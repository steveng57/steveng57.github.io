We've had these growlight stands for a couple years now.  They let us get a jump on the greenhouse growing season by a couple of months by starting them indoors.  And in the middle of the season, before the batch in the greenhouse is totally spent, I can get a new bunch to the reayd.

They are meant to be put on a table, but they take up a lot of room that way.  Last year I tried to get clever and I stacked them on top of each other.  Which was a great space-saver, and it worked great, until it didn't.  It collapsed and left a muddy mess all over the basement floor, and took me over three hours to clean up.

### Open Spaces

So rather than tempt fate and risk it happening again, this year I decided to do it properly and create a suitable stand, and bolt it to the wall so it would not go anywhere.

### Sturdy Stacks

The wood is just your standard 1&Prime;x3&Prime;, which isn't very thick but more than enough to support this weight.  

It better be.

It's also bolted to the studs in the back, cause I am super paranoid now.  It was quite the mess.

## In Production

All seeded and seated.  The grow light stays on for about 16 hours a day, giving them a good head start.  

Dwarf Curled Scotch Kale on the bottom, and Grand Rapids Lettuce on the top.  Look, I don't make the names.
