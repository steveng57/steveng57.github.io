This was a custom commissioned piece by the customer (Debbie).  She wanted an end table to fit just right by the sectional near the pool.  I wanted a place to safely store my speakers from the elements.  This piece did the trick.

## Details

![Table Sketchup]{: .left .w-66 }I did a couple of layouts of the table in {{ site.data.links.sketchup }}, just to get a feel for things.  We went with the wider version on the right.

![Table from left]{: .left .w-66 }I wish I had taken a lot more pics while this one was under construction.  It is one of my first works I can be proud of as a real piece of furniture.  Here are a couple of shots from the left and right, showing off the new finish I started using:  {{ site.data.links.rubio }}.  It is an awesome products, a hard-wax oil which bonds with the wood to make it look great.  Wonderful colouring, but the best thing is that it still feels like wood, instead of polyurethane which makes thing feel a little like plastic.

![Table from right]{: .right .w-66 }Bad shot, but its one of the best I have right now.  

The camera makes it appear shinier than it is in real life, where it has a nice satin finish.
