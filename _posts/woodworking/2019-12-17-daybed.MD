This is one of my more ambitious projects. Lots of new things attempted here, joinery I had never done before.  I modelled this out in Visio (kinda like Powerpoint), and got to work.

## Background

The Daybed ordered by the customer (Debbie), is going into her yoga room, so she wanted it painted a serene warm colour.  I am not a fan of painting wood, but in this case I think it worked out well.

Cutting the boards to make the slats was fun.  Lots of curved pieces had to be thrown out.  I learned a lot about wood movement here, the most important thing being that there is so much of it.

## Big Glue-ups

The Daybed.  

Yes, Daybed is to be spelled in with a leading capital in this context.  

Because!!!

Big glue-up are always fun.  Ten minutes is what it says on the bottle.  Yikes, with this many moving parts, well that made it exciting.  The customer pitched in though and we made it thru.

## Almost Ready

Waiting for paint.

I had to clear out the main shop to make room to paint this, thankfully almost everything is on wheels.

Painted.  Now just some plywood for the foam to sit on, and then lug it upstairs.

My buddy Mike helped me lug this up the stairs from the shop to the yoga room.  Was worried for a couple of minutes there that it wouldn't fit, but we made it.
