There really is no more fun a project than a shop project. Doing shop stuff is perfect for practicing your craft, honing your skills. And best of all, if you make a mistake, no-one will ever ever notice. Except you of course, where the mistake will be staring at you from across the room, taunting you, snickering, slowly driving you crazy until you are forced to fix it. Ask me how I know.

## Details

### 15 Drawers

These were a lot of fun to make, and they turned out great for the most part. The drawer slides are a little bit fidgety, but they work.

The thing I remember most about this one is that there were 15 drawers here. Yes, 15. Not only do things get very tedious at that count, but also a little scary. Scary because if you have made a mistake on one of them, then there is a good chance that you have made the same goof on all 15. Not a pleasant thought. Thankfully that didn't happen here, but that doesn't mean that I didn't sweat it.

_Did I mention that there were **15** drawers!!!_

### Baltic Birch

This was the first time I had done any extensive work with Baltic Birch plywood. This is marvelous stuff to work with, and several notches above anything you can get at the big box stores.

Still waiting on the spindle sander.

Ok, I really like this pic, so showing it again in higher resolution. Not really, this is just a placeholder waiting on a pic showing what it looks like today.

## Materials
