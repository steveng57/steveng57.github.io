Only had a couple of days after finishing the previous project before Debbie's birthday, but I decided to try something new and get in done in time for her day.

On this box, the grain flows all the way around, and is sometimes called a "continuous grain" or "matching grain" design.  When done on a piece with a horizontal surface that flows onto a vertical one, it is often called a "waterfall".  

This is actually a pretty complicated thing to do.  And if you make a mistake on a board, you need to fix it or else throw out all the boards, since the grain won't match if you try to substitute a new board.

## Under Contruction

So what you do is make a board long enough to make a side plus one end of the box.  You need to make it thick enough so that it is double the thickness of your final boards.

In my case, I did the above, but also put a maple strip in there, fashioned at an angle, to give the piece a little contrast.

Then you cut the board in two, slicing it down the middle, yielding two long boards that are each in turn cut to produce an end and a side piece.  If you do it right, the grain looks like it is flowing all around.
