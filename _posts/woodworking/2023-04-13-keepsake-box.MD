Only had a couple of days after finishing the previous project before Debbie's birthday, but I decided to try something new and get in done in time for her special day.

## Under Construction

On this box, the grain flows all the way around, and is sometimes called a "continuous grain" or "matching grain" design. When done on a piece with a horizontal surface that flows onto a vertical one, it is often called a "waterfall".

This is actually a pretty complicated thing to do. And if you make a mistake on a board, you need to fix it or else throw out all the boards, since the grain won't match if you try to substitute a new board.

So what you do is make a board long enough to make a side plus one end of the box. You need to make it thick enough so that it is double the thickness of your final boards.

In my case, I did the above, but also put a maple strip in there, fashioned at an angle, to give the piece a little contrast.

Then you cut the board in two, slicing it down the middle, yielding two long boards that are each in turn cut to produce an end and a side piece. If you do it right, the grain looks like it is flowing all around.

I am not sure I am making myself clear here, no do I think I can in this post.  But if you really want some of the finer details on this stuff, check out the YouTube video from [The Wood Whisperer](https://www.youtube.com/@woodwhisperer){:target='_blank'} on the [Four Corner Grain Match](https://youtu.be/SUd3I6Kx1Z0?si=ZVx0jnFtcppiO9HG){:target='_blank'}.
