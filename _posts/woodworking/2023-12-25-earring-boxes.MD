## Some Background

I really like making special things for other people. This is a fun example of that. Debbie thought it would be cool to make a set of earring boxes for her sister for Christmas. I could not agree more. This was a first of its kind for me. While I have made a great many boxes in the past, the insert was a whole new kind of thing.

> **Cool Tool**: The {{ site.data.links.shaper }} was critical here, no way I could make this with just tools. It is truly an amazing machine.

## Under Construction

{% include html-side.html img="earring-box-sketchup.jpeg" align="left" %}
### Design
Here is an exploded view from {{ site.data.links.sketchup }}.

The design on this changed a fair bit along the way.  I had originally planned on the holes and bottom being one piece with the holes stopping about 6mm from the bottom.  But then getting the green velvet in each hole would have been very difficult, not to mention that they were 72 of them.  

In the end I added a detached bottom, and routed the holes all the way through.  Then placed a sheet of green velvet between the two for final assembly, much easier.

### Finishing
Doing the finish on this one was pretty messy, partly due to the number of pieces, and also all the nooks and crannies to get into.

Nice to have a big work surface to spread out. Especially when you are a messy, messy woodworker.

### Squares

The insert with all the squares was cut as a separate piece from the main box. It was carved using the {{ site.data.links.origin }} from a single block of walnut. This left me with about 72 little cubes of walnut that I still haven't figured out what to do with.

{% include html-side.html img = "IMG_0467.jpeg" align = "left" %}

### Velvet

The green velvet was placed on the bottom of the box and the insert placed over it.

The top engraving was a little nerve wracking. Make a mistake here and it's hard to patch nicely.

## Ready

Here they are, ready and waiting for the big day.
