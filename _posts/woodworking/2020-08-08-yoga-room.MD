I've made a few things for the customer's (Debbie) yoga room.  In 2020 I made an oval (ellipsoid?) table to go inside a curved wall, and a dolly/stand for her heater on casters.

## Danger Danger

I am including a closeup pic here of the handle here because this is one of my first truly scary experiences in the shop.  I was using the router table to put a round-over on the inside and outside of the handle curves so that it was more comfortable to use, when the router bit grabbed ahold of the piece, shattered it and violently threw the many bits in all directions.  

>**Pro tip:** Shop tools are moody, downright cranky.  They are also sharp and can be nasty.  They will always win a fight, and have no remorse at all if they lop off a body part.  Let them do their thing, but keep your hands away and never try to _save_ a workpiece.  Just walk away.

## The Heater Dolly

![Heater Dolly Handle][Heater Dolly Handle]{: .left .w-66 }This is the dreaded heater dolly handle.  It looks innocuous, but is anything but.

## The Yoga Room Table

![Yoga Room Table][Yoga Room Table]{: .left .w-66 }The table for the yoga room was very fun to make.  It is a big chunk of maple to which I applied a router template to do the radius.

I think this was one of the first times I took a big gouge out of a workpiece, right on the visible edge.  The repair work took longer than the cuts did, but I think the resulting fix was pretty good.  There is no damage visible, thanks to that final coat of paint.

Note the tapered legs, a first for me.

This is a pic of the heater in place, with some spare room for a humidifier or a popcorn bowl.
