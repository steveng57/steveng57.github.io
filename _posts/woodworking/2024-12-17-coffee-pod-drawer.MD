## Background
I decided to make this coffee pod drawer for Matt this year for Christmas.  I was lucky enough to get his name in our Secret Santa drawing, and he is famous for his love of a good cup of joe, so I thought this would be a good fit.  

Custom made to fit a particular spot in his kitchen, I enlisted the help of my spy network to get proper dimensions and started the design process.

## The Coffee Pod Drawer

### The Design

Started with Sketchup {{ site.data.links.sketchup}}, and did the layout of the drawer box and the drawer itself.  It's very nice to get the dimensions all lined up.

### Walnut Offcuts

One of the Secret Santa rules is that there is a budget limit, hence I raided the offcut pile for supplies, so this cost $0 in my book.  There was a surprising amount of good quality walnut available, as I had recently done a few big walnut projects. 

The smaller size of this project made it easier to find pieces that would work.

### The Drawer

The drawer itself consists of the sides and bottom, both of which involved the Shaper Origin.  

The sides were thinner than a normal box, only about 10mm thick, so the corner joinery had to be stronger than just a butt joint and some glue.  I opted for finger joints (aka box joints) on this one.

For the bottom, I carved seven rows of three circles as nestling places for the pods.  I don't know how well that will work over time as it is a bit of a pain to place them all neatly in the circles.  I expect that eventually the pods will be tossed in the drawer a little ad-hoc.  I know that's what I would do.

### The Drawer Front

#### The Inlay

The font is called "Satisfy", which is oddly satisfying.  Designed in Shaper Studio, and carved with the Shaper Origin.

#### Chillin'

The epoxy is {{ site.data.links.chillepoxy }}, a light gray made by combining white with a drop or two of gray.

### Fit and Finish

The {{ site.data.links.rubio }} was a bit different this time: instead of the normal two or three coats and then another of the maintenance oil, I used a new product from them called SheenPlus, which creates a satin finish.  First coat is the normal walnut oil, then the SheenPlus and you're done.

## Odds and Ends

So a couple of interesting things about this project, they are small things, but as this was my first real project of the season and I am kind of rusty, I am very happy with how they turned out.
- Home made **drawer slide**. Well it is not a drawer slide as much as it is a drawer track, a couple of strips of wood inset on the sides of the box to make sure that the drawer is snug and centered.  The hard-wax oil that is used to finish it should let it all slide in and out quite nicely.
- I made my own walnut **edge banding** to cover the end-grain on the front of the drawer box.  I got a new drum sander about a year ago and they are perfect for things like this.  I don't think I could have made this without it.

## Materials and Tools

- Walnut from {{ site.data.links.kjp }} originally, though this one was made with offcuts
- {{ site.data.links.rubio }} walnut for finish, with their new sheen product for a bit more satin look
- {{ site.data.links.origin }} for cutting the box joints and the front inlay
- White and gray {{ site.data.links.chillepoxy }}
