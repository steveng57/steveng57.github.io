Sometimes I can't wait to start a project where I get to try something new, especially if it's something that you just know that you are going to use a lot in the future.

{% include head-mypost.html %}

In this case it was a technique called _Template Routing_. As the name implies, you fashion template to your workpiece, usually with double-sided tape or hot-glue, and then use the edge of the template to register against a bearing in a template routing bit on your router. This makes a great edge, exactly matching the template.

So your template had better be good. I have since discovered that sometimes doing the template properly can be half the work on a project.

These floating shelves (sometimes called a _blind shelf_) have a 4 inch radius cut with such a template. The radius was done on these so that people would not get stabbed in the hip when walking by.

## The Workout Room Shelf

{% include html-sxs.html img1="IMG_0743.jpeg" img2="IMG_0744.jpeg" %}
These shelves are make from red oak, which is a very dense hardwood, meaning they are heavy. A special [floating shelf support](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/hardware/storage-and-organization/shelf-supports/51933-blind-shelf-supports){: target="\_blank"} is used to make sure the shelf is properly supported.

## The Hallway Shelf

{% include html-sxs.html img1="IMG_0751.jpeg" img2="IMG_0752.jpeg" %}
Both these shelves have 45&deg; bevel on the underside. It's a pretty big bevel so a pretty big bit was used to hog it out. Multiple passes of course.

## Sketchup

The shelves are 8 inches deep by 32 inches wide by 1.5 inches thick.

And pretty much everything I make requires a {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} drawing. Here it is.
