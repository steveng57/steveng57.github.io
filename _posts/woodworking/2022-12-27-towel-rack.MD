At the request of the customer, I made a custom towel rack to fit precisely in a bathroom space. Working with round things is always a bit of a nifty challenge, as it was here. There were some funky angles to work with and some odd shaped pieces.

> **Cool Tool**: The {{ site.data.links.shaper }} was used here. The angled pieces could have been cut by hand I guess, but the accuracy of the Origin is far superior to that.

## Under Construction

{% include html-side.html img="towel-rack-sketchup.jpeg" align="left" %}
I designed the rack in {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} to make sure it was all the right dimensions. Sketchup is a cool tool for modelling 3d things digitally. It takes a bit of getting used to, but there are a lot of Youtube videos out there on how to get started, and if you have worked with any CAD type software before, it will come more easy to you. Once you have your 3d model, export the parts to the {{ site.data.links.origin }} and you are off to the races.

I was a little worried about moisture affective the piece, since it was going to be installed in a bathroom and subject to lots of humidity, and also damp towels directly on the rods. So...I heavily lathered everything with 6 or 7 coats of poly, making sure the rods got an extra dose.

The rods are solid maple, picked up at {{ site.data.links.leevalley }}.  Pretty strong and with all that poly, they should resist any moisture.

## In Position

Its been in use for over a year at this point and no issues with warping or bending so far.  Fingers crossed.
