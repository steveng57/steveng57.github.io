When I set out to do this, I hadn't really thought of the complications that are involved in doing angled cuts like this. I mean, I knew there would be some, but I had to really dig deep and resurrect some old trigonometry skills. Nah, not really, I used an online calculator, but still it was a lot of weird angles. It's a 15&deg; angle to the sides, but when you are doing the cuts, it's a double mitre angle cut at 13.1&deg; tilt, and 34&deg; mitre. Yikes.

## Under Construction

This is the {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} drawing used to plan the whole thing.

It ended up being bigger than this in the end, as I called an audible during the construction process. Doing such a reckless thing can often come back to haunt you, but in this case it worked out okay. The overall size was never an issue, it was all those angles that were the risky part.

As seems to be my usual for mitres these days, I used the {{ site.data.links.domino }} to add strength to the mitre, and make it easy to glue-up.

### Crazy Angles

A fun build, while the angles were indeed odd, it was a lot of fun to see it come together.

## In Production

A tray full of munchies in its new home, which is normally resting upon the [extension table](/posts/extension-table) from the previous post.

## Materials

- Walnut from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- Grey epoxy by {{ site.data.links.chillepoxy }}
- {{ site.data.links.shaper }} for the lettering
- {{ site.data.links.domino }} for mitre joinery
