Christmas is a great time to be a maker.  Making stuff with your own hands to give to friends and family is the most rewarding thing about the woodworking craft.  

{% include head-mypost.html %}

Over tha past few years, the east coast side of the family has decided to have everybody draw the name of another family member to gift to.  I drew Bill's name two years in a row, in 2021 and 2022.  It was super fun to make these for Bill, because he is an all-round great guy and a wonderful human being.  He's the best.

## The Stand

### Computer Support

I designed the stand in Sketchup, with a number of people sneeking into Bill's office to take measurements of his notebook and computer setup so that I could get the dimensions right.  It took a bit of skullduggery but we made it work.

### Drawer

One thing that was novel here was that I made the drawer slides myself out of hardwood.  It wasn't as hard as I had expected, although I probably watched about a half-dozen videos to make sure I knew what was going on.

## Everywhere a Sign

### Epoxy Inlay

The sign was designed on {{ site.data.links.shaperhub }} with some clip-art and my favorite font: comic-sans.  It really doesn't get the respect it deserves.  Probably because it has _comic_ right in the name.

This was a gift to Bill for Christmas 2022.

## Materials

- Walnut for the sign, red oak for the stand, both from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- {{ site.data.links.domino }} for the mitre joinery
- {{ site.data.links.origin }} for the carve
- {{ site.data.links.rubio }} for both finishes
