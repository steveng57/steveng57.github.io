## Some Background

Christmas is a great time to be a maker. Making stuff with your own hands to give to friends and family is the most rewarding thing about the woodworking craft.

Over tha past few years, the east coast side of the family has decided to have everybody draw the name of another family member to gift to. I drew Bill's name two years in a row, in 2021 and 2022. It was super fun to make these for Bill, because he is an all-round great guy and a wonderful human being. He's the best.

## The Stand

### Computer Support

I designed the stand in Sketchup, with a number of people sneaking into Bill's office to take measurements of his notebook and computer setup so that I could get the dimensions right.

It took a bit of skullduggery but we made it work.

### Drawer

One thing that was novel here was that I made the drawer slides myself out of hardwood. It wasn't as hard as I had expected, although I probably watched about a half-dozen videos to make sure I knew what was going on.

## Everywhere a Sign

### Epoxy Inlay

The sign was designed on {{ site.data.links.shaperhub }} with some clip-art and my favorite font: comic-sans. It really doesn't get the respect it deserves. Probably because it has _comic_ right in the name.

This was a gift to Bill for Christmas 2022.

## Materials

- Walnut for the sign, red oak for the stand, both from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- {{ site.data.links.domino }} for the mitre joinery
- {{ site.data.links.origin }} for the carve
