## Some Background

Every shop needs a workbench, and there is a first for everything. This is the first workbench I built in this shop.

In setting up my workshop, I had the DeWalt mitre saw from a while back, bought the Rigid table saw from the local Home Depot. With the help of my buddy, I threw some pegboard on the wall and I was in business.

## The First Workbench

### Unpainted and Raw

Then, I decided to make my first workbench / assembly table. I have become quite enamored with assembly tables as future posts will tell.

This one was fairly straightforward. A whole lot of 2x4s from the big box store, pocket screws holding it all together.

I put some {{ site.data.links.kreg }} track on the top, the blue aluminum extrusion shown here, which one can use to clamp things down. I finished it off with some enamel orange paint and coated the 2x4s in a couple of coats of Tung oil.

{% include clear-float.html break = 1 %}

{% include html-side.html img="20170202_151701.avif" align = "right" %}

### Acrylic Paint

A couple of thick coats of orange acrylic paint to help make the top more durable. Cause I smash a lot of thing on it, like my thumbs.

Added a bottom shelf for more shop storage, because...you know...storage. I also added a vice to the side because...you know...vice.
{% include clear-float.html %}

## Today

While it is no longer my primary workbench / assembly table, it still gets a lot of use in the shop. It serves as an out-feed table for the table saw, as a staging area for other tools, and it still gets some exercise as a secondary assembly table.
