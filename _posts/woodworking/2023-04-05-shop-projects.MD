## Origins

In late winter of 2023, I decided a workshop upgrade was due. You can never have enough shop storage, and shop projects are always a fun way to get better at all kinds of things. You can experiment, and if it fails, no one will know. I generally try to reserve between &#x00BC; and &#x2153; of my shop time for shop projects.

## Under Construction

### Router Stand

I bought a couple or three pieces of plywood from {{ site.data.links.balticbirch }}, and fashioned up a {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} drawing of the router table I was going to make, along with one for the mitre stand.

### Steely

The steel top on the new router table is awesome. Nice level even cuts each and every time.

### Mitre Saw Stand

Each unit in the mitre saw stand is basically built as a big cabinet box with a drawer.

You build three of those and string them together using about 10 beefy cabinet screws, and there you have a mitre stand. Here you see it modelled in {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} before the construction began.

I made three of them and bolted them together with cabinet screws.

## In the Shop

It is so nice to have a proper set of workshop stands for the router and the mitre saw along this wall. I would show you a _"before"_ drawing so that you could see the difference, but that would be embarrassing.
