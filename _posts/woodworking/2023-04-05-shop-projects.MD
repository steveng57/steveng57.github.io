In late winter of 2023, I decided a workshop upgrade was due.  You can never have enough shop storage, and shop projects are always a fun way to get better at all kinds of things.  You can experiment, and if it fails, no one will know.

## Under Construction

### Router Stand

![Under Construction 3][Under Construction 3]{: .left .w-66 }I bought a couple or three pieces of plywood from {{ site.data.links.balticbirch }}, and fashioned up a {{ site.data.links.sketchup 
}} drawing of the router table I was going to make, along with one for the mitre stand.

![Under Construction 2][Under Construction 2]{: .right .w-66 }The steel top on the new router table is awesome.  Nice level even cuts each and every time.
{% include clear-float.html %}

### Mitre Stand

![Under Construction 4][Under Construction 4]{: .left .w-66 }Each unit in the mitre stand is basically built as a big cabinet box with a drawer.  You build three of those and string them together using about 10 beefy cabinet screws, and there you have a mitre stand.  Here you see it modelled in {{ site.data.links.sketchup }} before the construction began.

## In the Shop

It is so nice to have a proper set of workshop stands for the router and the mitre saw along this wall.  I would show you a _"before"_ drawing so that you could see the difference, but that would be embarrassing.
