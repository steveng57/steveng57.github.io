After our kitchen remodel, the client (Debbie) asked me to fashion a couple of custom pieces for the new kitchen island.  Made from poplar and painted to match the cabinetry, I added a few carvings to them to spice them up a bit and filled them with epoxy inlay.

## Footstool

I've made many a footstool since taking up the craft.  Deb likes to use this one when sitting on the barstools are the new island.  Everyone seems to love the heart carved into the sides.  Me too.

## The Computer Stand

This stand was custom made to the exact height.  Storage underneath for the keyboard when not in use.  Of course I had to do something on the engraving just to keep it lively.
