After our kitchen remodel, the client (Debbie) asked me to fashion a couple of custom pieces for her use at the new kitchen island.  The footstool and the computer stand get used every day, very cool.  Made from poplar and painted to match the cabinetry, I added a few carvings to them to spice them up a bit and filled them with epoxy inlay.

## Footstool

I've made many a footstool since taking up the craft.  Deb likes to use this one when sitting on the barstools are the new island.  Everyone seems to love the heart carved into the sides.  Me too.

## The Computer Stand

This stand was custom made to the exact height.  Storage underneath for the keyboard when not in use.  Of course I had to do something on the engraving just to keep it lively.

## The Design

{% include clear-float.html break  = 1 %}

Not much to the design here, it's really just a box after all.  I did the font layout in Shaper Studio, an online design tool that goes with the {{ site.data.links.origin }}.  I used Microsoft Word to layout the text with a comic-sans font, uploaded it to Shaper Studio for the final prep, then downloaded to the Origin for the carve.  _Easy peasy lemon squeezy._  I have no idea what that saying means, but it's fun to say.

## Materials

- Poplar from {{ site.data.links.kjp }}
- Latex paint to match the kitchen
- The carve was done with the {{ site.data.links.origin }}
