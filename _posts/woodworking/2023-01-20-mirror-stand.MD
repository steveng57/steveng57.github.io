A cool part of woodworking is that you can do custom designed stuff. In this case, very custom. This is a combination mirror stand, makeup tray, and jewelry box holder all-in-one. Made from poplar to keep it light, with lots of engraving done with the {{ site.data.links.origin}}.

## The Box

{% include html-side.html img="mirror-stand-shaperhub.jpeg" align="left" %}
It starts with the design, which in this case was done on the web via {{ site.data.links.shaperhub }}. 

I took a bunch of clip-art that suited the box and put them together on this drawing, then transferred that to the {{ site.data.links.origin }}.

### Rings and Things

Once the design imported to the Origin, you carve, and before the assembly, you pour some epoxy. In this case the epoxy was sprinkled with copious amounts of glitter, which was very fitting for this kind of piece. 

The photo doesn't show it very well, but it sparkles. Trust me.

### Bling

The process was similar for the _Bling_ side of the box, but I used a single-line-font specially selected from [Single Line Fonts](https://www.singlelinefonts.com){{ site.tb }}. This site has a bunch of cool fonts that work well with these kinds of projects, all at reasonable price.

## Badda Boom Badda Bling

Here it is with the mirror installed. The top has a couple of trays carved in it for holding earings or makeup.
