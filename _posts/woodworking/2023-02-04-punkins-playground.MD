This table was specially made to fit into Debbie's craft area setup. It of my own design, and turned out to be very sturdy even though its a 4ft by 8ft span.

## Under Construction

A big piece of 4x8 Baltic Birch plywood was used as the main surface. If you've not worked with that material before, I highly recommend it. It is nice stuff, super strong, made of 13 layers of wood instead of the 5 or 7 you get at the big box store. You can get it here at {{ site.data.links.balticbirch }}, check it out!

![Under Construction 2][Under Construction 2]{: .left .w-66 }To make it strong enough over that 4x8 span, it created a 'Torsion Box' using various scraps of other plywood that I had lying around from other projects. It basically means that you put 3 to 4 inch strips running down the length and width of the plywood, which makes it incredibly strong. The maple trim around the outside also helped with the structural integrity.
