This table was specially made to fit into Debbie's craft area setup. It of my own design, and turned out to be very sturdy even though it is a 4&#39; by 8&#39; span.

## The Design

{% include html-side.html img="punkins-playground-sketchup.jpeg" align="right" %}

As usual with most projects, the design starts in {{ site.data.links.sketchup }}.  It is a super-cool tool that, once you get the hang of it, lets you draw up things like this pretty quick.  It lets you really visualize the work.  

There is even a plug-in for Sketchup, called [Open Cut List](https://docs.opencutlist.org/){: target="_blank" }, that will take your drawing and generate a parts list for you, complete with all the cuts that need to made on either the plywood or the solid wood.  It's really quite amazing.

I really shouldn't be telling everyone all my secrets.

{% include clear-float.html break=1 %}

A big piece of 4x8 Baltic Birch plywood was used as the main surface. If you've not worked with that material before, I highly recommend it. It is nice stuff, super strong, made of 13 layers of wood instead of the 5 or 7 you get at the big box store. You can get it here at {{ site.data.links.balticbirch }}, check it out!

## Under Construction - Literally

### Torsion Box

To make it strong enough over that 4x8 span, it created a 'Torsion Box' using various scraps of other plywood that I had lying around from other projects. It basically means that you put 3 to 4 inch strips running down the length and width of the plywood, which makes it incredibly strong. The maple trim around the outside also helped with the structural integrity.

### Funky Legs

The legs worked well. I was a little nervous about this design at the outset, but it turned out rock solid, with 16 screws on each leg securing it to the top.  

The legs are removable in case we ever want to move it.  That's never going to happen.
