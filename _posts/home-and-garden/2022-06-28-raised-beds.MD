## Origins

These were a big first: Cedar Raised Beds for out back. These two were placed outside by the greenhouse, for growing tomatoes and things. I made three more (not pictured here) that were eventually placed in our small greenhouse out back.

When the weather gets warmer, I will head out back and take some pics of the finished product and post here.

## Under Construction

### Cedar

The Western Red Cedar was purchased just down the way from where I live at a place called {{ site.data.links.woodsource }}. They have a great selection of hardwood and supplies to choose from. It's nice to have a place like this just a few minutes away.

Cedar is one of the best smelling woods when you cut into it. It releases a wonderful aroma that sticks around for days. If only all woods smelled as good.

### It's Extreme

These were eventually finished with another product from {{ site.data.links.woodsource }} called [Cutek Extreme]{:target="\_blank"}, which is an outdoor wood protection oil.

The neat thing about this stuff is that they have a pretty broad spectrum of colouring called "Colourtone" that you can add to the base product so that you can get exactly the colour you want.

## Ready For Stain

{% include html-side.html img="20220628_125950.avif" align="left" %}

It's a pretty messy oil stain, but it's not too thick.  It's a little thicker than water so you can easily slop it on.

## In Production

Three of the smaller beds are in our greenhouse in the back.  Not sure I would have gone thru all that work just to put something in a greenhouse, but hey, I have squandered time and energy on many more useless things than this.
