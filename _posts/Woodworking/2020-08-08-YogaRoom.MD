## Introduction

I've made a few things for the customer's (Debbie) yoga room.  In 2020 I made an oval (elllipsoid?) table to go inside a curved wall, and a dolly/stand for her heater on casters.

## Danger Danger

I am including a closeup pic here of the handle here because this is one of my first truely scary experiences in the shop.  I was using the router table to put a roundover on the inside and outside of the handle curves so that it was more comfortable to use, when the router bit grabbed ahold of the piece, shattered it and violently threw the many bits in various directions.  

>**Pro tip:** Shop tools are mooody.  They are sharp and can be nasty.  They will always will a fight, and have no remorse at all if they lop off a body part.  Let them do their thing, but keep your hands away and never try to _save_ a workpiece.

## The Yoga Room Table

Big glue-up are always fun.  Ten minutes is what it says on the bottle.  Yikes, with this many moving parts, well that made it exciting.  The customer pitched in though and we made it thru.
