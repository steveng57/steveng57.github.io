This is a strange one, and looking back on it, not one that I am all that proud of.  It was designed to be a general purpose bench to be placed near the dog-run door to attend to  many things pup-related.  That, and throw in a plant stand for good measure.  Lots of learning what NOT to do on this one.

## Details

There were a couple of firsts for me on this one, including under-mount drawer slides and rubber paint (more on this below), which made it fun.

But its heavy.  Really heavy, I would not make it like this again if I had a do over.  There is way to much wood used here, 3/4 thick ply where 1/4 inch would have done just fine.  Double layers where one would have been plenty. and the solid red oak for most of the exterior doesn't help keep it light.  

There are so many pocket holes holding this thing together, its just silly.  Half that amount would do.

I built it low to the ground so that the boys could jump on it easy enough, so I left off the trim on the bottom, but I think that looks odd, unfinished.

## On the Positive Side

One the positive side, you could drive a tank on it, and I think it would hold.

There are a couple of cool things about this bench though, some stuff where I was completely winging it:  

- The bottom left drawer is actuall a step, so that when it is pulled out the boys (our dogs) actually have a way to jump up on the bench so that when they need cleaning coming in from the outside.
- The rightmost bottom two drawers are actually a single double-depth drawer for storing boats.  I am kinda happy at how you cannot tell that this is the case.
- The top right thing is a plant box.  It was waterproofed with about 56 layers of a paintable rubber compound, which is one of the messiest things I have ever done.  It is still holding watertight a couple of years later...we'll see.

## Retirement

This is one of my first pieces to be 'retired', where we will soon be taking it out of the house and using it on our garage porch.  We'll still get some good use of it.

## Materials

- Plywood frame
- Solid red oak trim
- Lots and lots of pocket screws
- Rubber paint
