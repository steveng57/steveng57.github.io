## Introduction

Welcome to my photo blog of various "maker" things I am up to, mostly wooodworking.  It will also contain a few other things, like life-hacks, yard and house projects and other maker things, but mostly woodworking.

## Some Background

Around 8 or 9 years ago, I started to setup a workshop in the basement.  Retirement was around the corner, and my one of my fathers favorite wisdoms was to retire to something, not retire from something.  I had the Dewalt mitre saw from a while back, bought the Rigid table saw from the local Home Depot.  With the help of my buddy, I threw some pegboard on the wall.

## The First Workbench

Then, I decided to make my first workbench / assembly table.  I have become quite enamored with assembly tables as future posts will tell.
