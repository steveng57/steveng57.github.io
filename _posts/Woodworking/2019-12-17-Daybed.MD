## Introduction

This is one of my more ambitious projects. Lots of new things attempted here, joinery I had never done before.  I modelled this out in Visio (kinda like Powerpoint), and got to work.

## Background

The Daybed ordered by the customer (Debbie), is going into her yoga room, so she wanted it painted a serene warm colour.  I am not a fan of painting wood, but in this case I think it worked out well.

Cutting the boards to make the slats was fun.  Lots of curved pieces had to be thrown out.  I learned a lot about wood movement here.

## Big Glue-ups

Big glue-up are always fun.  Ten minutes is what it says on the bottle.  Yikes, with this many moving parts, well that made it exciting.  The customer pitched in though and we made it thru.
