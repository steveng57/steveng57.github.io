Shop furniture is the best place to practice.  In this case it was practice with dowels, rods, and other round things.  

## Details

The shop vac worked well enough, but it was always getting clogged and was quite the mess to clean.  I decided to do an upgrade to the cylone separator, and added a hepa filter to keep the air clean.  But once you do that, you also need a way to move it around the shop.

Yah know, I was going to insert some cute lyrics from the Luis Armstrong song, "Hello Dolly", but I looked them up and the lyrics are a tad mysoginistic and creepy.  Eek.
