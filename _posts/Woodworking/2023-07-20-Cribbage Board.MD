For my father's birthday, I made him this walnut cribbage board. He says it is working well and that it keeps very good score.

Almost half the work on this one was at the computer making sure the design was right.  I didn't do the entire layout, I spent about $20 for a design off of Etsy, then made a bunch of modifications using the online tools from [Shaper Hub]{:target="_blank"}.

## Under Contruction

Lots of pictures on this one.  Hey, it was a lot of work.

The sheer madness of trying to do 391 individual holes with the router, even a computerized one, is...well...madness.

_391 holes.  Go ahead...count 'em._

_Another angle_

On the back, I did a little signature thing.  I eventually fixed the half-finished g in August.  I also carved out a couple of storage holes for pegs with a magnetic seal.
