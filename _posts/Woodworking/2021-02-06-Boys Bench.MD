## Introduction

This is a strange one, and looking back on it, not one that I am all that proud of.  It was designed to be a general purpose bench to be placed near the dog-run door to attend to  many things pup-related.  That, and throw in a plant stand for good measure.  Lots of learning what NOT to do on this one.

## Details

So its heavy.  Really heavy, I would not make it like this again if I had a do over.  There is way to much wood used here, 3/4 thick ply where 1/4 inch would have done just fine.  Double layers where one would have been plenty.  There are so many pocket holes holding this thing together, its just silly.  I built it low to the ground so that the boys could jump on it easy enough, so I left off the trim on the bottom, but I think that looks odd, unfinished.

## On the Positive Side

One the positive side, you could drive a tank on it, and I think it would hold.

There are a couple of cool things about this bench though, some stuff where I was completely winging it:  

- The bottom left drawer is actuall a step, so that when it is pulled out the boys (our dogs) actually have a way to jump up on the bench so that when they need cleaning coming in from the outside.
- The rightmost bottom two drawers are actually a single double-depth drawer for storing boats.  I am kinda happy at how you cannot tell that this is the case.
- The top right thing is a plant box.  It was waterproofed with about 56 layers of a paintable rubber compound, which is one of the messiest things I have ever done.  It is still holding watertight a couple of years later...we'll see.
