## Introduciton

I've made various decorative trays over the years.  These usually serve as centre pieces for a table, and hold things like candles or ornaments.

## Background

These are pretty simple to make, basically a box without a lid.  But they are great for practice and developing skills and joinery techniques.

In my early versions of these, I made them entirely out of solid wood, mostly red oak.  This is all good, but with the bottom made out of solid wood, well they are heavy.  Too heavy in some cases.  The one on the dining table is hard for me to lift.  If I had to do it over again, I would make the bottoms out of plywood to save on weight and cost.

>**Pro tip**: Don't make something so heavy that even you can't lift it.
