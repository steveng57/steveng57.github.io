## Introduction

One of my first tricky projects was a bean bag toss game.  Fun around the pool in the back yard.  

## Background

I hadn't done a whole lot of circles and curves with the router before.  This changed that in a hurry.  To make the curves on the outside rim, I had to make a really big jig, like six feet long that provided the proper radius.

## Mistakes Were Made

While the face board was just your vanilla big-box-store plywood, the back boards were made of cedar.  My thinking at the time was that this choice would be a good one since these are outdoors and on the grass a lot.  The problem is that cedar is a very soft wood, and my screws were doing all kinds of wonky things, most problematically not staying were they should.

Copious amounts of waterproof glue helped fix the situation.

Debbie stamped some dog paw prints on the final version which made it look really cool.  I will add a pic of that when the spring thaw comes and the back shed is a little more accessible.
