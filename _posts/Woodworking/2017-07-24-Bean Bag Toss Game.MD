One of my first tricky projects was a bean bag toss game.  Fun around the pool in the back yard.  

## Getting to Work

I hadn't done a whole lot of circles and curves with the router before.  This changed that in a hurry.  To make the curves on the outside rim, I had to make a really big jig, like six feet long that provided the proper radius.

The inner circles were just done with a router circle jig I crafted.  Drilled some pilot holes for the jig pin to fit in, and off to the races.

## Mistakes Were Made

While the face board was just your vanilla big-box-store plywood, the back boards were made of cedar.  My thinking at the time was that this choice would be a good one since these are outdoors and on the grass a lot.  The problem is that cedar is a very soft wood, and my screws were doing all kinds of wonky things, most problematically not staying were they should.

>**Pro tip**: Cedar is a squishy wood. Use it wisely.

Copious amounts of waterproof glue helped fix the situation.

Debbie stamped some dog paw prints on the final version which made it look really cool.  I will add a pic of that when the spring thaw comes and the back shed is a little more accessible.
