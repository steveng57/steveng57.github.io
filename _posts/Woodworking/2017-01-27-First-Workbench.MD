Every shop needs a workbench, and there is a first for everything.  This is the first workbench I built in this shop.

## Some Background

In setting up my workshop, I had the Dewalt mitre saw from a while back, bought the Rigid table saw from the local Home Depot.  With the help of my buddy, I threw some pegboard on the wall.

## The First Workbench

Then, I decided to make my first workbench / assembly table.  I have become quite enamored with assembly tables as future posts will tell.

This one was fairly straightforward.  A whole lot of 2x4s from the big box store, pocket screws holding it all together.  I put some Kreg track on the top, the blue aluminum extrusion shown here, which one can use to clamp things down with.  Finished it off with some enamel orange paint and coated the 2x4s in a couple of coats of tung oil.
