These were a big first.  Cedar Raised Beds for outback.  These two were placed outside, for growing tomatoes and things.  I made three more (not pictured here) that were eventually placed in our small greenhouse out back.  

When the weather gets warmer, I will head out back and take some pics of the finished product and post here.

## Under Contruction

The Western Red Cedar was purchased just down the way from where I live at a place called [The Wood Source]{:target="_blank"}.  They have a great selection of hardwood and supplies to choose from.  Its nice to have a place like this just a few minutes away.

These were eventually finished with another product from The Wood Source called [Cutek Extreme], which is an outdoor wood protection oil.  The neat thing about this stuff is that they have a pretty broad spectrum of colouring called "Colourtone" that you can add to the base product so that you can get exactly the colour you want.
