This was a custom commissioned piece by the customer (Debbie).  She wanted an end table to fit just right by the sectional near the pool.  I wanted a place to safely store my speakers from the elements.  This piece did the trick.

## Details

I wish I had taken a lot more pics while this one was under construction.  It is one of my first works I can be proud of as a real piece of furniture.  Here are a couple of shots from the left and right, showing off the new finish I started using:  Rubio Monocoat.  It is an awesome products, a hard-wax oil which bonds with the wood to make it look great.  Wonderful colouring, but the best thing is that it still feels like wood, instead of polyurethane which makes thing feel a little like plastic.
