In late winter of 2023, I decided a workshop upgrade was due.  You can never have enough shop storage, and shop projects are always a fun way to get better at all kinds of things.  You can experiment, and if it fails, no one will know.

## Under Contruction

I bought a couple or three pieces of plywood from [KJP Select Hardwoods]{:target="_blank"}, and fashioned up a sketchup drawing of the router table I was going to make, along with one for the mitre stand.

The steel top on the new router table is awesome.  Nice level even cuts each and every time.
