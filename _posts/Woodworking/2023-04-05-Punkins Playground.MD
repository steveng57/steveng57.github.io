This table was specially made to fit into Debbie's craft area setup.  It of my own design, and turned out to be very sturdy even though its a 4ft by 8ft span.

## Under Contruction

A big piece of 4x8 Baltic Birch plywood was used as the main surface.  If you've not worked with that material before, I highly recommend it.  It is nice stuff, super strong, made of 13 layers of wood instead of the 5 or 7 you get at the big box store.  Bought mine at [KJP]{:target="_blank"}, check it out!

To make it strong enough over that 4x8 span, it created a 'Torsion Box' using various scraps of other plywood that I had lying around from other projects.  It basically means that you put 3 to 4 inch strips running down the length and width of the plywood, which makes it incredibly strong.  The maple trim around the outside also helped with the structural integrity.

The legs worked well.  I was a little nervous about this design at the outset, but it turned out rock solid, with 12 screws on each leg securing it to the top.
