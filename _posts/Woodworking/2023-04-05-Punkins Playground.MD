This table was specially made to fit into Debbie's craft area setup.  It of my own design, and turned out to be very sturdy even though its a 4ft by 8ft span.

## Under Contruction

A big piece of 4x8 Baltic Birch plywood was used as the main surface.  If you've not worked with that material before, I highly recommend it.  It is nice stuff, super strong, made of 13 layers of wood instead of the 5 or 7 you get at the big box store.  Bought mine at [KJP]{:target="_blank"}, check it out!
