This one was really simple, but a much needed project.  Just a box really, but a couple of steps to make life easier for Riley and Ozzie, jumping up on the daybed, or on the mudroom desk to get ready to go for a walk.

## Under Contruction

This was the first time I attempted any engraving or detail work, note the paws on both steps.  The first paw prints for the mudroom were done freehand with a stencil and router and then painted.  The second set of prints was done with my new [Shaper Origin]{:target="_blank"}.  Much more on this tool in coming posts, its one of my favorite things ever.  In both cases, the prints were carved about 6mm deep.
