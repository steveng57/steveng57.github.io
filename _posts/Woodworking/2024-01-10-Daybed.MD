## Introduction

This is one of my more ambitions projects. Lots of new things attempted here, joinery I had never done before.  I modelled this out in Visio (kinda like Powerpoint), and got to work.

## Background

The Daybed ordered by the customer (Debbie), is going into her yoga room, so she wanted it painted a serence warm colour.  I am not a fan of painting wood, but in this case I think it worked out well.

Cutting the boards to make the slats was fun.  Lots of curved pieces had to be thrown out.  I learned a lot about wood movement here.

## Big Glue-ups

Then, I decided to make my first workbench / assembly table.  I have become quite enamored with assembly tables as future posts will tell.
