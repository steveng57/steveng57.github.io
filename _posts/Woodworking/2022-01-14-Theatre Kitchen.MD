This was a long project and my first shot at doing kitchen-style cabinetry.  We had some space at the back of our theatre room, and it seemed like a good use of the space to make this happen.  

## Under Contruction

It took a bit over a month in the shop to make this one come together.  

It was all good up until this point.

### Oops

_Waiting for my drawer faces_

It was at this point I went to put on the drawer faces, pictured below.  To my shock and horror, I made them **the wrong size!** Instead of being the required 762mm in width, they were made 726mm in width.  My mild dislexia had bitten me once more.  These are still in my shop, awaiting the next project that requires four drawer faces of exactly 726mm width.

### The Floor

Installing this on the basement floor was quite a challenge.  The floor is not level, not even close.  There is about a 40mm (1.5in) drop from one end to the other that I had to shim on the toe-kick.  Thankfully, there were quite a few YouTube videos on dealing with this exact problem.

### The Fridge

### Lighting

Since the theatre room is sometimes very dark, I added a lot of in-cabinet lighting throughout.  I hooked up microswitches to all the doors and drawers to control them.

## In Production

We scavenged the granite top from our upstairs kitchen remodel and repurposed it down here.  It fit almost perfectly, just had to carve off a bit off the end.
