These picture frames are sometimes called "Shadow Boxes" or "Shadow Frames".  They really add a lot to the artwork that they frame.  I have a bunch more to do, but these are a good start.  

## Under Contruction

Nothing too fancy here, but there is a bit of finess in making them strong, since the frame thickness is only a little over a cm.  Festool dominoes are strategically placed at the mitres to give added strength, and while they are a bit of extra work, they make alignment during the glue-up much easier.

I used a new kind of paint on this one, mixing a couple of colours together to get just the right shade.  The interior of the frame is painted black to accentuate the shadow effect.

_Making two is almost the same amount of work as one_

I made these out of poplar, it's a lighter wood, but still strong enough.  Not as sappy as pine, and paints very well.  Less pricey than other woods, and if you are going to paint it anyway, might as well spend more on the paint and less on the wood.
