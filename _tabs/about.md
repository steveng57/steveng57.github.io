# All about me (Not really)

>**Steven Goulet** - generally a happy camper.

Welcome to my photo blog of various "maker" things I am up to, mostly wooodworking.  

I have been focussing more and more on "maker" type things, including woodworking for the last decade or so. Woodworking is my primary focus, but I like to include other things...anything high tech or gadgety will do nicely. This site will also have a few other things, like life-hacks, yard and house projects and other maker things, but mostly woodworking.

Sometime in late 2016, I started to setup a workshop in the basement.  Retirement was around the corner, and my one of my fathers favorite wisdoms was to _"retire to something, don't retire from something"_.  

I live in a rural suburb of Ottawa called Manotick with my wife Debbie and two boys, Riley and Ozzie.

I am also a Pisces, which is silly because there is no science behind that stuff at all, and if you beleive in it, then I have some magic pixie dust to sell you, but that's about all you are going to get about me.
