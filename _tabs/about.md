I have been focussing more and more on "maker" type things, including woodworking for the last decade or so. Woodworking is my primary focus, but I like to include other things...anything high tech or gadgety will do nicely.

I live in a rural suburb of Ottawa called Manotick with my wife Debbie and two wonderful boys, Riley and Ozzie.  I will post some pictures below soon.

I am also Pisces, but that's about all you are going to get about me.
