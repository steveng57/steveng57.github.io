# All about me.  (Not really)

>**Steven Goulet** - generally a happy camper.
{: .prompt-tip }

I have been focussing more and more on "maker" type things, including woodworking for the last decade or so. Woodworking is my primary focus, but I like to include other things...anything high tech or gadgety will do nicely.

I live in a rural suburb of Ottawa called Manotick with my wife Debbie and two boys, Riley and Ozzie.  I will post some pictures below soon.

I am also a Pisces, which is silly because there is no science behind that stuff at all, and if you beleive in it, then I have some magic pixie dust to sell you, but that's about all you are going to get about me.
