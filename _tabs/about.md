Welcome to my photo blog of various "maker" things I am up to, mostly woodworking.  The above picture is a sign hanging in my workshop, given to me by the family.  It's pretty cool.

## About this site

The [Home Page]({% link index.html %}) is an inverse chronological listing of the various projects I have taken on.  As you go further back in time, the projects get a little more primitive...not that my more recent things are perfect, but you learn a lot over time in this craft.  Some of that learning I have actually managed to apply in my more recent efforts.

In the early days, I did not take many pictures of the shop or the projects as they were in progress, so a lot of the pics will be of the finished product.  I will be taking more "under construction" photos as time progresses, hopefully that will make the posts more interesting to those of you who like a bit of the "behind-the-scenes" thing.

The [Image Gallery]({% link _tabs/gallery.md %}) is an alphabetical listing of all the images in all the posts on the site.  This is meant to be a purely visual experience, and if you want more details on something of interest, you can clip on the image to drill down into the original post.

For an interesting layout of the posts in chronological order, be sure to check out the [Timeline View.]({% link _tabs/timeline.md %})  The "Posted" date at the top of each blog post is actually the rough date of when the project took place, and this view is sorted by that timestamp.

The [Categories]({% link _tabs/categories.md %}) link shows the posts group by their categories and sub-categories.  I am just getting these categories sorted as of this writing.

The [Tags]({% link _tabs/tags.md %}) links will display a tag wall splattered with all tags from all posts.  Click on a random one to see what fun that brings.

To all the fans of this website, pictured below, please be [let me know](mailto:steveng57@outlook.com) if you find any bugs or other inaccuracies.  This is very much a work in progress.

# About the author

I have been focussing more and more on "maker" type things, including woodworking for the last decade or so. While woodworking is my primary focus, but I like to include other things...anything high tech or gadgety will do nicely. Also, life-hacks, yard and house projects and other maker things, will do nicely but mostly woodworking.

Sometime in late 2016, I started to setup a workshop in the basement.  Retirement was around the corner, and my one of my father's favorite wisdoms was to _"retire to something, don't retire from something"_.  I could not agree more.

I live in a rural suburb of Ottawa called Manotick with my wife Debbie and two boys, Riley and Ozzie.

I am also a Pisces, which is silly because there is no science behind that stuff at all.  The other thing you should know about me is that I am all about science.  Actually, that one fact probably tells you a lot about me, from my political leanings, to my thoughts on religion, climate change, and more. 

But if you must know, politics wise, I am fiscally conservative (you can't spend money you don't have), and socially liberal (the only thing I am truly intolerant of, is intolerance).  Wait, TMI alert! Way too much information already!
