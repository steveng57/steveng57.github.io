Welcome to my photo blog of various "maker" things I am up to, mostly woodworking.  The above picture is a sign hanging in my workshop, given to me by the family.  It's pretty cool.

## About this site

The [Home Page]({% link index.html %}) is an inverse chronological listing of the various projects I have taken on.  As you go further back in time, the projects get a little more primitive...not that my more recent things are perfect, but you learn a lot over time in this craft.  Some of those learnings I have actually managed to apply in my more recent efforts.

In the early days, I did not take many pictures of the shop or the projects as they were in progress, so a lot of the pics will be of the finished product.  I will be taking more "under construction" photos as time progresses, hopefully that will make the posts more interesting to those who like a bit of the "behind-the-scenes" thing.

The [Image Gallery]({% link _tabs/gallery.md %}) is an alphabetical listing of all the images in all the posts on the site.  This is meant to be a purely visual experience, and it's a fun way to go throught things. 

> **Note:** If you want more details on something of interest in the image gallery, you can click on the **image caption** to drill down into the original post.

For an interesting layout of the posts in chronological order, be sure to check out the [Timeline View.]({% link _tabs/timeline.md %})  The "Posted" date at the top of each blog post is actually the rough date of when the project took place, and this view is sorted by that timestamp.

The [Categories]({% link _tabs/categories.md %}) link shows the posts group by their categories and sub-categories.  I am just getting these categories sorted as of this writing.  For now, there are two major categories: [Woodworking](/categories/woodworking), which is where the vast majority of posts exist, and [Home & Garden](/categories/home-garden), which only has a single post right now, but I expect more to go there as things progress.

The [Tags]({% link _tabs/tags.md %}) links will display a tag wall splattered with all tags from all posts.  Click on a random one to see what fun that brings.

To all the fans of this website, pictured below, please be [let me know](mailto:steveng57@outlook.com) if you find any bugs or other inaccuracies.  This is very much a work in progress.

## About the author

I have been focussing more and more on _maker_ type things, including woodworking for the last decade or so. While woodworking is my primary focus, I also like to include other things...anything high tech or gadgety will do quite nicely.  Also fair game are life-hacks, yard / garden / house projects and other _maker_ things...but mostly woodworking.

Sometime in late 2016, I started to setup a workshop in the basement.  Retirement was around the corner, and my one of my father's favorite wisdoms was to _"retire to something, don't retire from something"_.  I could not agree more.

I live in a rural suburb of Ottawa called Manotick with my wife Debbie and two boys, Riley and Ozzie.

I am also a Pisces, which is silly because there is no science behind that stuff at all.  The other thing you should know about me is that I am all about science.  Actually, that one fact probably tells you a lot about me, from my political leanings, to my thoughts on religion, climate change, and more. 

But if you must know, politics wise, I am fiscally conservative (you can't spend money you don't have), and socially liberal (the only thing I am truly intolerant of, is intolerance).  Wait, TMI alert! Way too much information already!
